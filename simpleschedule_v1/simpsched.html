                            Simple Schedule is one of the most beautiful and intuitive apps on Google Play for managing your school or university life.
                            You can save your classes and all tasks, from homework to exams, with ease. With Material Design its really an pleasure to use, so just try it out!

                        <p class="pt15M">
                            The main reason why i started this project was that i simply wasn't happy with the apps available at that moment.
                            I just wanted some clean, simple but nice looking app that could help me manage my university schedule.
                            Just right after that idea came to my mind i started drawing some elements i would like to have - especially some Material elements.
                            This resulted in this first sketch you can see here and that's where it all started.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt15M">
                            The first idea regarding this project was the 'Recent' section. Since this app was all about simplicity and
                            giving one a easy and fast glance at the schedule.
                        </p>

                        <p class="headingM">The 'Recent' section</p>
                        <p class="pt15M">
                            Since i knew from the beginning that this section would be the part that makes this app special (compared to normal calendars eg.) i quickly
                            decided that this should also be the main view. There are many reasons that support this decision which i will come shortly to but first:
                            <b>lets talk about Material Design!</b>
                        </p>
                        <p class="pt15M">
                            This part of the app is actually a great place too emphasize many ideas of Material Design. Since its the main interaction part of the app
                            its also much about interaction. <br> Talking about used elements: Since this screen is all about dynamic information and changing content,
                            the <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html">card view</a> came in pretty handy.
                            <br>
                            This is because cards both are great to resemble <b>Material's Paper metaphor</b> but also to show varying content. So cards are nice for showing grouped content
                            but also for single objects/information, but the thing that makes them great is the combination with actions.

                    <div class="content-it-block">
                        <p class="headingM">Cards</p>
                        <p class="pt15M">
                            So cards are good for showing grouped content but also for single information. Lets explore this with the recent cards. Basically there are two types used. <br>
                            The first one is a rich media card used to show the <b>current class</b>. Since this is a main interaction point and the most important element it utilizes
                            the classes bold colors to draw attention to it. It has multiple action areas, as shown in the illustration. There is a part to interact with the class - to
                            open a more detailed view of the class. Furthermore there is navigation area - to navigate to the next class but also a support action. <br>
                            As simple as the concept of a card looks, it is important to clearly structure it. Action elements, like buttons, should be clearly visible and have its one space.
                            With using rich media it is also possible to separate the content from the actions, but it is also used as an interaction point itself.<br>
                            The second card is more subtile as it isn't a main interaction point and only shows <b>further information</b>. Therefore it only uses gray tones.
                            The lines clearly separate the items (classes) and these also serve as interaction point to find more detailed information.
                        </p>

                        <p class="headingM">Colors and bold imagery</p>
                        <p class="pt15M">
                            Another important thing for a Material app is the usage of <b>bold colors and imagery</b>. These are mostly used to draw attention but also to structure the content clearly.
                            More important though is that these help to create a pleasant experience when using an app. Therefore many hours where spent to create some nice illustrations for the
                            classes - once again <b>huge thanks to </b> <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/112489536347680237131">Aron van de Pol</a> who helped me with creating some of those

                        <p class="pt15M">
                            The ability to sync your data with the cloud and thus between different devices is a essential feature
                            for most users. Therefore it was already added in the app's beta version. The desicion to use Google
                            Drive for this was simply because of lack of resources to build an own sync service.<br><br>
                            <b>How does it work</b><br>
                            Basically the sync service is build on the back up ability of the app. So whenever there are changes made and/or
                            new information is added the service creates a back up of this data and pushes it to Google Drive. <br>
                            The interesting part was the implementation to allow multiple devices to share the same data. Therefore
                            every device/app that shares the same accounts adds timestamps to the changes it makes. So when one has older
                            changes then another those doesn't get synced since the newer ones are used.

                        <p class="pt15M">
                            The apps icon, as simple as it seems, is one of the most important things for an app. The reason for this is, that the icon is the first interaction point a user has with an app. Therefore many different variants were tried which resulted in this simple and clean icon. The goal was to resemble a calendar, but also showing the main style of the app. Therefore a card is used since this is the main interaction point in the apps main view.
